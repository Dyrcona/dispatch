.TH dispatch 3 "December 23, 2013"

.SH NAME
dispatch - fork a process

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <dispatch.h>\fP
.br
\fBpid_t dispatch(char *\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB);\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdispatch\fP() function forks a process and invokes \fIcommand\fP
via \fB/bin/sh -c\fP \fIcommand\fP.
.PP
Unlike \fBsystem\fP(3), \fBdispatch\fP() does not call \fBwait\fP(2). It
is the responsibility of the calling process to wait for and cleanup its child
processes.

.SS Return Value
Upon successful return, this function returns the \fBpid_t\fP value returned
from \fBfork\fP(). This should be a positive value. In the case of error
forking, a -1 is returned. This function should never return 0.

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBsh\fP(1), \fBfork\fP(2), \fBwait\fP(2), \fBsystem\fP(3)
