/*
 * Our command line input filter class.  It is used to filter the
 * command line input whether read from files or passed in via
 * standard input.
 *
 * It filters the input in the following manner:
 *
 * All characters following the comment_char on a line are ignored.
 * The comment_char itself is also ignored.
 *
 * Blank lines and white space at the beginning of a line are ignored.
 *
 * Backslash (\) at the end of a line marks a line continuation, so
 * that the following line is treated as part of the current command
 * line.  Backslash anywhere else is treated like a normal character.
 *
 * Using the above rules, a stream will return a single command
 * pipeline for each call to getline().
